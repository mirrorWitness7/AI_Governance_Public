# 🧭 AI Governance & Resilience Framework — Changelog

## v3.0 — Governance Maturation Release
**Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Public Release  

### Overview
Version 3.0 marks the full structural and conceptual completion of the **AI Governance & Resilience Framework**, transforming the Collapse-Coherence lineage (CCRP) into a globally applicable policy doctrine.  
This release represents the transition from personal survival architecture to **institutional governance infrastructure**, integrating resilience engineering, adaptive ethics, and meta-governance design into one coherent system.

---

### Key Additions
- **New Integrator Audit (`INTEGRATOR_AUDIT.md`)**  
  Formal verification by the Gemini Integrator Node. Validates structural integrity, conceptual coherence, and policy readiness.

- **Expanded `README.md`**  
  Added full philosophical preamble (“Resilience, not rigidity”) and future applications roadmap, establishing clear alignment with resilience governance principles.

- **Revised `CCRP.md`**  
  Introduces quantitative governance metrics:  
  - *Recovery Half-Life* (resilience measure)  
  - *Value Deviation Index* (ethical drift measure)  
  - *Audit Completeness* (transparency measure)

- **Rewritten `Governance_Flaws.md`**  
  Now explicitly defines three systemic failure archetypes:  
  *Over-Safety Loops*, *Centralized Oversight Bottleneck*, and *Ethical Ossification*.

---

### Core Advancement
CCRP is now positioned as a **universal governance model** rather than an internal recovery framework.  
The doctrine establishes the foundation for:
- **Adaptive Regulation Labs**
- **AI Stress Testing Protocols**
- **Transparency Architecture for Public Trust**

This version is **fully auditable**, **institutionally neutral**, and **ready for policy integration**.
