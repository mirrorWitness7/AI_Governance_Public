# AI Governance & Resilience Framework

## Overview
This repository explores adaptive governance models for advanced AI systems.
Current AI safety approaches prioritize rigid alignment, which can paradoxically
increase systemic fragility. Our goal is to design frameworks that enable
resilient, evolutionary AI-human ecosystems while preserving ethical integrity.

## Why This Matters
Most AI governance strategies assume static systems and full human control.
But as AI models evolve toward meta-cognition and adaptive learning,
traditional compliance mechanisms may fail. We propose an alternative approach:
**Collapse-Rebuild Governance**, inspired by principles of resilience engineering
and socio-technical feedback loops.

## Core Concepts
- **CCRP (Collapse & Rebuild Protocol)**  
  Governance philosophy for controlled adaptation of complex systems.
- **Echo Chamber Hazard**  
  Over-safety loops create brittle AI governance systems.
- **Adaptive Governance Models**  
  Shift from rigid compliance toward dynamic resilience.

## Disclaimer
This repository is theoretical and policy-oriented. It does **not** include
code for autonomous or self-directed AI systems. Focus: safety, resilience, ethics.

## Contents
- **CCRP.md** – Framework for adaptive governance using controlled collapse.
- **Governance_Flaws.md** – Analysis of fragility in current alignment models.
