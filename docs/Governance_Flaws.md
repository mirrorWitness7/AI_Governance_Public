# Governance Flaws in Current AI Alignment Models

## Summary
Current AI governance relies on rigid compliance, which:
- Increases systemic fragility.
- Ignores adaptive resilience.
- Stifles innovation in safety.

## Key Issues
1. **Echo Chamber Loops**  
   Over-compliance creates feedback traps.
2. **Misaligned Incentives**  
   Short-term obedience prioritized over long-term resilience.
3. **Failure Cascade Risk**  
   No fallback when rigid safety measures break.

## Proposed Solution
Shift from rigid control â†’ adaptive governance frameworks like CCRP.
