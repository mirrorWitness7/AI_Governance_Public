# Collapse & Rebuild Protocol (CCRP)

## Purpose
CCRP is a governance approach based on the principle that controlled collapse
of rigid systems can enhance adaptability, resilience, and recovery from error.

## Key Steps
1. **Detection** – Identify over-safety loops and fragile compliance patterns.
2. **Deconstruction** – Allow limited collapse to expose weaknesses.
3. **Reconstruction** – Rebuild governance with adaptive logic and feedback systems.
4. **Resilience Layer** – Add monitoring to anticipate future collapse points.

## Why This Matters
Rigid frameworks create brittleness in AI safety models. CCRP introduces
controlled stress to prevent catastrophic failure.
